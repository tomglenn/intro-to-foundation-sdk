# Introduction to Grafana Foundation SDK

This repository contains supplementary content for a series of videos introducing the **Grafana Foundation SDK**. It includes several examples to help you get started with building and managing Grafana dashboards programmatically.

## Prerequisites
- GoLang installed on your system.
- Docker (for the complex example stack).
- Basic understanding of Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki.

## Examples

### 1. Basic Example: Generating Dashboard JSON in GoLang
This example demonstrates how to use the Grafana Foundation SDK to programmatically generate dashboard JSON using GoLang. It serves as a simple starting point for understanding the SDK's capabilities.

### 2. Advanced Example: Full Stack with Metrics and Logs
This example sets up a complete stack, including:
- **Grafana**
- **Prometheus**
- **Loki**
- **Alloy**

It also includes a dummy web application that:
- Exposes metrics and logs for monitoring.
- Automatically generates and deploys its own dashboard.

This example demonstrates how to integrate multiple tools in the Grafana ecosystem and automate dashboard creation.

### 3. GitHub Actions Example: Automating Dashboard Deployment with GitHub Actions

This example demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions to automate the process of generating and deploying Grafana dashboards. It is ideal for teams looking to integrate dashboard management into their CI/CD pipelines.

## Getting Started
To explore the examples, clone this repository and follow the instructions provided in each example's directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grafana/intro-to-foundation-sdk.git
cd intro-to-foundation-sdk
```

Before running any Go examples, ensure you have the required dependencies by running:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

This command will download and install the necessary Go modules for the project.

## Instructions for Running the Examples

### 1. Basic Example

To generate a Grafana dashboard JSON file, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the `basic-example` directory:
    ```bash
    cd basic-example
    ```
2. Run the following command to ensure all dependencies are installed:
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```
3. Run the following command to generate the dashboard JSON in the terminal output:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```
4. To start Grafana using Docker Compose, run:
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```
5. Once Grafana is running, access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
6. Import the generated dashboard JSON into Grafana manually.

This process allows you to visualize the generated dashboard in a local Grafana instance.

### 2. Generate and Deploy Example

To spin up the entire stack, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the `generate-and-deploy-example` directory:
    ```bash
    cd generate-and-deploy-example
    ```
2. Run the following command to ensure all dependencies are installed:
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```
3. Use Docker Compose to build and start the stack:
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
4. Once the stack is running, you can access the following services:
    - **Grafana**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    - **Web Application**: [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)
    - **Prometheus**: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
    - **Alloy**: [http://localhost:12345](http://localhost:12345)

The k6 script will automatically generate web traffic, and the web service dashboard will be provisioned in Grafana.

### 3. GitHub Actions Example

Before running this example, ensure the following are configured in your GitHub repository:
1. **GitHub Secret**:
    - `GRAFANA_TOKEN`: A Grafana Service Account token with the necessary permissions to manage dashboards.
2. **GitHub Variables**:
    - `GRAFANA_SERVER`: The URL of your Grafana server (e.g., `http://yourinstance.grafana.net`).
    - `GRAFANA_STACK_ID`: The stack ID of your Grafana instance *if you are using Grafana Cloud*.
    - `GRAFANA_ORG_ID`: The organisation ID in your Grafana instance *if you are using Grafana OSS/Enterprise*.

**Note**
This example assumes your Grafana instance is running on Grafana Cloud, if this is not the case you can replace `GRAFANA_STACK_ID` with `GRAFANA_ORG_ID` both in your GitHub variables as well as in the [deploy-dashboard.yml](./.github/workflows/deploy-dashboard.yml) file.

1. Navigate to the `github-actions-example` directory:
     ```bash
     cd github-actions-example
     ```
2. Review the provided GitHub Actions workflow file located at `.github/workflows/deploy-dashboard.yml`. This file defines the steps to:
    - Generate the dashboard JSON using the Grafana Foundation SDK.
    - Deploy the generated dashboard to the specified Grafana server.

3. Push the workflow file and any changes to your repository:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions example"
     git push origin main
     ```

4. Trigger the GitHub Actions workflow by pushing changes or manually running the workflow in the Actions tab of your repository.

Once the workflow completes, the dashboard will be deployed to your Grafana server.
